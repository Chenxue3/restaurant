### 🧪 Staging Environment Access

You’ve received the `.env` file for our **staging environment**, which means:

* You can freely **create**, **modify**, or **delete** data.
* This environment is intended for **testing and development** only.
* Please place the `.env` file in the `api` directory before running the project.

### 🛠️ Troubleshooting

If you run into any issues:

* Feel free to **contact us via email**
* Or **open an issue on GitHub**

⚠️ **Heads-up:**
Some services may occasionally become unavailable due to **unpaid invoices** or billing interruptions. We try to avoid this, but it might happen.
