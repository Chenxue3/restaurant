## What Makes Our Product Stand Out:
- You can view detailed menu information in your native language.

- You can make, modify, or cancel a restaurant reservation simply by chatting with our chatbot.

- While dining at the restaurant, you can request services by talking to the chatbot—no need to wait for a staff member to walk by.

## Why Restaurants Choose SmartSavor:
- Use AI to provide better service to customers.

- Reduce operational costs—no more phone calls for reservations, and less need for staff to run around the restaurant.

## Why Users Choose SmartSavor:
- Ordering food is no longer a headache. View the menu in your native language, including allergy info, flavor descriptions, and images of each dish—so you know exactly what you're ordering.

- If you're shy or uncomfortable speaking a foreign language in a non-native country, just communicate with the chatbot in the language you're most comfortable with.

- Don’t like making phone calls to manage restaurant bookings? Just chat with the chatbot to make arrangements.
